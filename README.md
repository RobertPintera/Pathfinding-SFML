# Pathfinding
The program is an implementation of the A* algorithm for pathfinding. The SFML and IMGUI libraries were used to create this program. In the application you can choose different heuristics or how to navigate the board.\
Sources of knowledge I used to learn about this algorithm:

# How to use
The application provides suitable buttons to control the operation of the program. When you select the appropriate tile, you can add it with the left mouse button or remove it with the right mouse button on the board.
